## Basic methods
### 1. Monte Carlo Simulations

Step 1: Model the uncertainity as a normal distribution and select return at each step to forecast.<br/>
Step 2: Repeat step 1 to obtain multiple possible outcomes.<br/>
Step 3: Quantify results in terms of mean, max, min predictions along with mean forecast.<br/>
